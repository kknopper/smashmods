Put the cxx folder in: 
"data > fighter > peach > model > body"

Put the kassar (The umbrella) folder in:
"data > fighter > peach > model > kassar"

Put the content of the chr folder in: 
"data > ui > replace > chr" 

Rename the two x's to whatever number you want the skin or icon to be in.
But remember the chr stuff starts with 01 and not 00!
So if you put the skin in 03 you will have to rename the chr stuff to 04.

Thank you for downloading!
